      A boy called Smilo is playing a new game! In the game, there are 洧녵
 hordes of monsters, and the 洧녰
-th horde contains 洧녩洧녰
 monsters. The goal of the game is to destroy all the monsters. To do this, you have two types of attacks and a combo counter 洧논
, initially set to 0
:

The first type: you choose a number 洧녰
 from 1
 to 洧녵
, such that there is at least one monster left in the horde with the number 洧녰
. Then, you kill one monster from horde number 洧녰
, and the combo counter 洧논
 increases by 1
.
The second type: you choose a number 洧녰
 from 1
 to 洧녵
, such that there are at least 洧논
 monsters left in the horde with number 洧녰
. Then, you use an ultimate attack and kill 洧논
 monsters from the horde with number 洧녰
. After that, 洧논
 is reset to zero.
Your task is to destroy all of the monsters, meaning that there should be no monsters left in any of the hordes. Smilo wants to win as quickly as possible, so he wants to the minimum number of attacks required to win the game.
